# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

Task was to create an app â€“Â any app â€“Â with React Native. I settled for a fairly basic reaction speed test game, where the user gets to test her reaction speed. 

## The problem

As always, I planned the work in Figma beforehand. Initially, I aimed fairly high, with a global scoreboard, see your average reaction speed, and such. However â€“Â still struggling from not fully understanding state hooks, how React Components are rerendered, as well as Javascript fundamentals â€“Â I quickly ran into some basic issues which required hours of debugging. Running out of time for this week, I had to scrap the plans and focus on the core game loop. I did manage to get it working, in the end, so I put a pin in it there. It might not be the best reaction speed game out there, but at least it's my reaction speed game.
